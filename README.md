This is a simple clojure app which takes as input a series of events with start and end times and prints all pairs of overlapping events.

## Instructions

Install clojure however you do on your system; in my case (macOS) it was simply `brew install clojure`. Then run `clojure overlapping-events.clj`. The program will print instructions on how to use it.
